ðŸ§© is an esoteric programming language that uses 10 characters. It can be easy to learn, but the purpose is to lower the number of bytes need for each program (It sometimes doesn't work).
## Installation
Just download the HTML file. 129513 is coded with Scratch, and compiled with TurboWarp.
## Tutorial
In ðŸ§©, there are only 3 and main variables:

Pointer (number)

Integer (number)

String (text)

Here are the 7 characters and what they do:

$ Change the pointer by 1

% Change the pointer by -1

@ Set the integer to the pointer's location in the memory

< Clear the string

> Add the integer to the string

+ Print the string

& Set the string variable to user input

/ Set the integer variable to user input

[ Change the pointer's location in the memory by 1

] Change the pointer's location in the memory by -1


ðŸ§© has it's own unicode table:

0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!@#$%^&*()
